  yourself using multiple subsystems and machines to scale, creating new 
 headaches in configuration management. Help is at hand! This tutorial in
 troduces Chef, a modern Ruby-based open source approach to systems integ
 ration. Chef lets you manage your servers by writing code, not running c
 ommands.

SUMMARY:Testing, Design, and Refactoring
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Jim Weirich (EdgeCase LLC), Joe O'Brien (EdgeCa
 se, LLC). Everyone seems to be on the TDD/BDD bandwagon these days.  We 
 have gotten very good at the first two phases of the Red/Green/Refactor 
 cycle.  But in our push toward releasing new code and functionality, som
 etimes the Refactor phase gets the short end of the stick. Sadly, withou
 t refactoring, our code base can quickly become a nightmare of highly co
 upled, highly redundant code.
